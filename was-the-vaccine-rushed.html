								<h1>Was the vaccine rushed?</h1>
							</header>
							
							<p>The vaccines followed the same rigorous testing and approval process that Health Canada uses for <b>all</b> other vaccinations and medical products. No steps were skipped, and all safety procedures were followed.</p> 
							<p>The vaccines were developed quickly because of technological advances and because nonmedical parts of approval (bureaucratic processes and rubber-stamping) were fast tracked. Several additional factors also accelerated the pace of development:
								<ul>
									<li><b>Effort</b>: <u>Tens of billions of dollars</u> were given to the world’s top scientists to help make the vaccine, and this collaborative effort led to rapid development</li>
									<li><b>Monitoring</b>: Health Canada is constantly looking at new science and research as it emerges around the COVID-19 vaccines</li>
									<li><b>Priority</b>: The vaccine was given priority to pass through the administrative process quickly, but no safety steps were skipped</li>
								</ul>
